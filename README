FAST-FORWARD (FF) LIBRARY
Unified Operating System interface.

FFOS library allows to write cross-platform code for 3 OS:
	. FreeBSD
	. Linux
	. Windows

The supported languages are C and C++.

The resulting code is almost completely inlined by a compiler: the code is native, high-performance but still cross-platform.


FEATURES

FFOS currently supports:
	. files
	. pipes
	. directories
	. native file-system paths
	. sockets
	. network address; IPv4/IPv6 address
	. threads
	. heap memory
	. native system string
	. date and time
	. system error codes
